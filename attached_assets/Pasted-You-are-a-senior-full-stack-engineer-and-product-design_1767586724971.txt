You are a senior full-stack engineer and product designer.

Build a personal-use web application called **CodeVault** — a modern, dark-theme, database-backed clone inspired by how codeshare.io works.

========================
CORE BEHAVIOR
========================
1. Base URL: https://codevault.io

2. When a user visits:
   - https://codevault.io/
     → Redirect to a newly generated random room URL
     → Example: /x7a9k2

3. When a user visits:
   - https://codevault.io/test
     → If "test" exists in database, load its content
     → If it does not exist, create it as an empty room

4. Each room:
   - Has a unique slug (custom or auto-generated)
   - Stores text/code content in the database
   - Auto-saves on typing (debounced)
   - Persists even after browser close
   - No authentication required (v1)

========================
DATABASE REQUIREMENTS
========================
Use a real database (PostgreSQL / MongoDB / SQLite).

Each room must store:
- room_id (slug)
- content (text)
- created_at
- updated_at
- created_ip
- last_accessed_ip
- last_accessed_at
- is_private (boolean)
- password_hash (nullable)
- expires_at (nullable)

Track IPs only for basic auditing (no analytics bloat).

========================
FEATURES (MVP)
========================
✔ Dark theme only (no light mode)
✔ Clean, distraction-free UI
✔ Monospace editor (like VS Code)
✔ Auto-save indicator
✔ Manual "Copy" button
✔ Download as .txt file
✔ Clear room button (owner only)
✔ Room persistence via URL
✔ SEO-safe but no indexing

========================

- No ads
- No login modal
- Smooth animations

OUTPUT REQUIRED
========================
1. Complete system architecture
2. Database schema
3. API endpoints
4. Frontend routing logic
5. Sample UI layout
6. Security considerations
7. Deployment guidance

Build this as a production-ready personal project with clean code, scalability in mind, and zero unnecessary complexity.
